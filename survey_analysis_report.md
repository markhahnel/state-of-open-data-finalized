## Survey Design Evolution

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Exploration (2017)
- 374 questions covering every aspect of data sharing
- Detailed sub-questions for nuanced understanding
- Focus on barriers, motivations, and current practices

### Phase 2: Policy Focus (2019)
- Streamlined to 186 questions
- Strong emphasis on funding mandates and policy support
- Introduction of credit mechanism questions

### Phase 3: Open Science Integration (2021-2022)
- Broader open science context
- FAIR and CARE principles introduction
- Balanced approach to multiple open science practices

### Phase 4: Focused Essentials (2023-2024)
- Dramatic simplification
- Core attitude questions maintained
- Emphasis on most important trend indicators

## Recommendations for Unified Schema

### Core Longitudinal Questions (High Priority)
1. **Open Science Attitudes** (4 questions - consistent across 2021-2024)
2. **Demographics** (Job title, research area, publication history)
3. **Data Sharing Frequency/Practice** (simplified version)
4. **Credit for Data Sharing** (key motivator)

### Supplementary Questions (Medium Priority)
1. **FAIR Principles Awareness** (2022-2023)
2. **Policy Support** (2019 focus)
3. **Collaboration Patterns** (2021-2022)

### Historical Context Questions (Low Priority)
1. **Detailed Barriers** (2017 comprehensive analysis)
2. **Specific Tools/Repositories** (2017 detailed assessment)
3. **Licensing Practices** (2017 focus)

## Data Quality Considerations

### Consistent Response Scales
- Most Likert scales use 5-point agreement scales (Strongly agree to Strongly disagree)
- Some variation in neutral option labeling ("Neutral" vs "Neutral/No opinion")
- 2019 includes "Don't know" option more frequently

### Question Wording Stability
- Core attitude questions show high stability (2021-2024)
- Demographic questions show reasonable consistency with expected evolution
- Some questions show significant rewording that may affect comparability

### Missing Data Patterns
- 2017: Extensive skip logic may create complex missing data patterns
- 2019: Simpler structure likely reduces missing data
- 2024: Minimal structure may improve completion rates

## Conclusion

The State of Open Data survey shows a clear evolution from comprehensive exploration to focused monitoring. The most reliable longitudinal trends can be tracked through:

1. **Open Science Attitudes** (2021-2024): Highly consistent 4-question battery
2. **Demographics** (All years): Reasonably consistent with expected evolution
3. **Data Sharing Practices** (All years): Core concepts consistent despite format changes
4. **Policy and Credit** (2019-2022): Important mid-period focus

The 2017 survey provides the most detailed baseline for understanding the full landscape of data sharing practices, while 2019-2024 provide the most reliable trend data for core attitudes and behaviors.
